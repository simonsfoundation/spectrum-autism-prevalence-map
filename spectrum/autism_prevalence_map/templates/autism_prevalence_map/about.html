                <h2 id="about">About the map:</h2>
                <p>This map was created by the team at <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/"><i>Spectrum</i></a>, the leading source of news and expert opinion on autism research. (<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/newsletters-alerts/">Subscribe to our newsletters</a>.)</p>
                <p>The map features a collection of studies on autism prevalence around the world. It highlights places where information is available — and places where information is missing.</p>
                <p>Each dot on the map represents a study. To identify these studies, we relied on our expert advisers. The darker dots represent studies that are recommended by the advisors for one or more reasons — although these studies may still be flawed in other aspects.</p>
                <p>We plan to update the map with new studies as they become available.</p>
                <div id="2" class="chapter-start"></div>
                <h2 id="how-to">How to use the map:</h2>
                <p>To see more information about a particular study, click on the corresponding dot. The window that pops up has key pieces of available information from that study.</p>
                <p>You can also view and filter the studies in the ‘list’ view. In either the map or the list view, you can use the filters in the top-right corner to display studies that match certain criteria, such as sample size, prevalence estimate and study type. And you can use the timeline at the bottom of the page to filter by the years in which studies were conducted or published.</p>
                <h3>Key to terms used on the map:</h3>
                <p><b>Prevalence</b> is shown on the map as the estimated number of autistic people per 10,000 individuals in the population studied.</p>
                <p><b>Confidence interval </b>refers to the uncertainty of a prevalence estimate. It is the range in which the true prevalence lies 95 percent of the time.</p>
                <p>When available, the study shows the proportion of participants with at least an <b>average intelligence quotient (IQ)</b> — the definition of ‘average’ IQ varies from study to study but typically refers to a score above 70 or 80.</p>
                <p><b>Diagnostic criteria</b> include the following options:<br>
                ABC — Autism Behavior Checklist<br>
